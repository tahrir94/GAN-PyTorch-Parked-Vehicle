# GAN-PyTorch-Parked-Vehicle
In this project, I implemented a Generative Adversarial Network using PyTorch based on the repo: https://github.com/diegoalejogm/gans/blob/master/1.%20Vanilla%20GAN%20PyTorch.ipynb, to generate fake images of parked vehicles. The discriminator network was trained on the dataset within "Parking_Lot_Vehicle_Images_UFPR04.zip" which contains 46,125 images of parked vehicles taken from security cameras in a parking lot.

"Project_4_Git.ipynb" contains all the information regarding the code implementation in the form of markdowns and comments. The document "Project 4 Report" also discusses the code implementation as well as the analysis of results.
